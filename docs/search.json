    "text": "I am a person with a diverse background and a passion for learning and growth. Graduating from Hanoi University of Transport and Communication, I initially embarked on a career path in a different field before transitioning into roles that align more closely with my interests and skills. I had 2.5 years of experience working in a hostel. During that time, I honed my leadership abilities by effectively managing a team of 5-7 members. The COVID-19 outbreak provided me with an opportunity to reflect and pursue further education, leading me to self-learn R programming and basic statistics. This newfound expertise opened doors for me at Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU) as a research assistant, where I specialized in data cleaning, visualization, and simple statistical analysis. Currently, I am based in the Mathematical Modelling group, where I work as a research assistant cum project coordinator for the Dengue Advanced Readiness Tools project."
